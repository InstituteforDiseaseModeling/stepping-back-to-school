'''
Main file implementing school-based interventions.  The user interface is handled
by the schools_manager() intervention. This primarily uses the School class, of
which there is one instance per school. SchoolTesting orchestrates testing within
a school, while SchoolStats records results. The remaining functions are contact
managers, which handle different cohorting options (and school days).

    This is the front end to the Schools class intervention.  Not much here,
    it's a sub-class of covasim's Intervention class.  The one piece of computation
    done here is to split the original school 's' network into individual schools.
    (Each school was already a separate component, but the code figures out which
    component goes with which school and extracts the subgraph.)

    The only input argument (aside from standard Intervention ones) is the scenario
    dict, which has one entry for each of the five school types, e.g.

        scenario = {
            'pk': None,
            'es': es_pars,
            'ms': ms_pars,
            'hs': hs_pars,
            'uv': None,
        }

    each of which has the following example structure:

            scen_pars = {
                'start_date': '2020-11-02',
                'seed_date': None,
                'schedule': 'Full',
                'screen_prob': 0.9,
                'test_prob': 0.5, # Amongst those who screen positive
                'screen2pcr': 3, # Days from screening to receiving PCR results
                'trace_prob': 0.75, # Fraction of newly diagnosed index cases who are traced
                'quar_prob': 0.75, # Of those reached by contact tracing, this fraction will quarantine
                'ili_prob': 0.002, # Daily ili probability equates to about 10% incidence over the first 3 months of school
                'beta_s': 0.75 * base_beta_s, # 25% reduction due to NPI
                'testing': test_pars,
            }

    The testing parameters object is a dict (or list of dicts), with the following
    structure. These coordinate testing interventions in schools:

            test_pars = {
                'start_date': '2020-10-26',
                'repeat': 7,
                'groups': ['teachers', 'staff'],
                'coverage': 1,
                'sensitivity': 1,
                'delay': 1,

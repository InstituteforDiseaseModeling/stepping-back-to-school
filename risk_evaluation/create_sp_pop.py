'''
Pre-generate the synthpops population including school types. Takes ~10s per seed
if running with 20,000 people; or roughly 10 times longer for 225,000 people.

After running this script, you will need to manually move the files generated in 
the inputs folder into the main results folder (v20201009).

Warning: this script is quite memory intensive. If you do not have much RAM, you may
wish to turn off parallelization.
